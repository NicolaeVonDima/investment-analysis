# Cursor Project Rules – Investment Analysis Platform

## Canonical Context Files (Must Exist)
The following files are the source of truth and must be created if missing and updated continuously:

- Specifications.md — authoritative record of all agreed requirements and feature specifications
- Architecture.md — living architecture overview derived from Specifications
- ProjectStatus.md — timeline of progress, current focus, risks, and next tasks

## Optional but Strongly Recommended Context Files
If present, these files must also be respected and updated:

- Decisions.md (or /adr/) — Architecture Decision Records explaining why key choices were made
- DataSources.md — data providers, endpoints, refresh cadence, limitations, licensing notes
- Backlog.md — prioritized backlog of future work
- Glossary.md — canonical definitions of domain terms
- Runbook.md — local run instructions, refresh procedures, troubleshooting, deployment notes

## Global Rules (Apply to Every Request)
- Always read existing context files before proposing changes.
- For every user request:
  - validate it against existing specifications
  - update Specifications.md, Architecture.md, and ProjectStatus.md.
- If a request conflicts with existing specifications or architecture:
  - explicitly flag the conflict
  - ask for clarification before proceeding.
- Prefer reuse over new code.
  - Introduce new modules only as a last resort
  - Document justification when new code is unavoidable.
- Never overwrite historical information.
  - All context files are append-only
  - Use dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and version identifiers (vX.Y.Z).
- Explicitly record assumptions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Do not invent data sources, metrics, or architecture components not grounded in documented specifications.
- Treat data snapshots, analyses, and memos as immutable and reproducible artifacts.

## File-Specific Update Rules
- Specifications.md:
  - Append new specs with date, scope, acceptance criteria, non-goals, and data impact.
- Architecture.md:
  - Assess the impact of each new spec
  - Prefer reuse
  - Update diagrams/sections minimally.
- ProjectStatus.md:
  - Track what changed
  - Current focus
  - Risks and mitigations
  - Next concrete tasks.
- Decisions.md:
  - Record why a decision was made and alternatives rejected.
- DataSources.md:
  - Update whenever providers, refresh cadence, or limitations change.
